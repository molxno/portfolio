  description: `
        Hi! I'm Santiago Molano, a passionate software developer based in Medellin, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´. 
        Currently pursuing a degree in Systems Engineering, I recently completed a specialization in 
        Cybersecurity through Google's professional programs. My adaptability and curiosity allow me to 
        actively contribute to any tech stack, making me a versatile team player.
        
        Over the years, I have delved into diverse projects that not only honed my technical skills but 
        also enhanced my problem-solving capabilities. I thrive in dynamic environments, whether it's 
        building robust backend systems, crafting interactive frontend applications, or exploring the 
        ever-evolving fields of cybersecurity and financial technologies.

        I'm committed to continuous learning and adapting to new technologies, frameworks, or tools, 
        making me a valuable asset in rapidly changing tech landscapes. Let's build something great together!
